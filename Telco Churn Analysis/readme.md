# **Teleconfia Customer Churn Prediction - Florida Market Entry**

This project aims to support Teleconfia's US market entry, specifically focusing on Florida, by leveraging customer churn prediction to optimize marketing efforts and reduce customer loss.

## **Project Goals:**

- **Identify High-Risk Areas:** Utilize customer data to pinpoint the four Florida city areas with the highest customer churn rates. This will guide targeted billboard marketing campaigns for maximum reach and impact.
- **Predict Individual Churn:** Develop a churn prediction model to identify individual customers at high risk of leaving Teleconfia's network. This information will enable targeted direct marketing actions like personalized calls and special offers.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Analyze relevant datasets to uncover factors that contribute to customer churn. This will inform strategic decision-making and customer retention efforts.
- **Model Development & Visualization:** Build a robust churn prediction model based on identified variables. Establish a critical probability threshold for defining likely churners. Compelling visualizations will be created to support presentations and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## **Dataset:**

The project utilizes a comprehensive customer behavior and service usage dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). This data provides insights into customer accounts, geographic details, and churn behavior at Teleconfia.

## **Key Features:**

- Account tenure (account_length)
- International calling plan subscription (international_plan)
- Voice mail plan subscription (voice_mail_plan)
- Customer service call history (customer_service_calls)
- Call usage patterns (total_day_minutes, total_eve_minutes, total_night_minutes)
- Churn status (churn)

## **Methodology:**

The project employs machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, to build a churn prediction model. Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries will be used for data visualization and exploration.

## **Outcomes:**

- Identification of the four Florida city areas with the highest churn rates.
- A churn prediction model to identify individual customers at risk of leaving Teleconfia.
- Actionable insights into factors influencing customer churn.
- Compelling visualizations for clear communication and decision-making.

This project presents valuable insights to guide Teleconfia's Florida market entry strategy, enabling them to prioritize high-risk areas, target at-risk customers, and ultimately minimize customer churn.
