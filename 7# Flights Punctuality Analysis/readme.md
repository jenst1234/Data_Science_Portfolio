# Flight Punctuality Analysis - LAX Airport

## Project Overview

The "Flight Punctuality Analysis" project provides a comprehensive analysis of flight punctuality at the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) between 2015 and 2017. Utilizing Microsoft Power BI, flight data were visualized and analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and influencing factors on flight timeliness. This project aims to offer valuable insights into operational efficiency and potential areas for improvement to airlines, airport management, and travelers.

## Background

As one of the busiest airports in the world, LAX is a critical hub in the global air traffic network. Flight punctuality is a key factor in customer satisfaction and the operational efficiency of airlines and airports. This project leverages the power of data visualization to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting flight timeliness.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on over 1.5 million flights handled at LAX from 2015 to 2017. Data points include departure and arrival times, flight numbers, airlines, scheduled versus actual flight times, reasons for delays, and more. These rich datasets provide a solid foundation for an in-depth analysis of flight punctuality.

## Objectives

- **Trend Analysis:** Examine the punctuality performance over the 2015 to 2017 period to detect improvements or deteriorations over time.
- **Influencing Factors:** Identify the main factors leading to flight delays at LAX, including weather-related delays, technical issues, and air traffic control measures.
- **Airline Comparison:** Compare the punctuality rates of different airlines to identify best practices and areas for operational improvements.
- **Daily and Seasonal Patterns:** Analyze times of day and seasons with the highest rates of delay to develop targeted management strategies.

## Methodology

Interactive dashboards and reports were created using Power BI, enabling dynamic exploration of the flight data. Visualizations include time series analyses, heat maps, bar charts, and more, all designed to provide users with an intuitive understanding of analyzed trends and patterns.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis revealed that certain times of the year, times of day, and even specific airlines exhibit significantly different punctuality rates. Identifying patterns and trends in the data yielded key insights that can help airlines and airport operators make operational decisions to improve timeliness.

## Applications and Future Work

Insights from this project can contribute to the development of strategies to enhance punctuality and minimize flight delays. Future work might include integrating additional datasets, analyzing more airports, or investigating specific causes of delays.
