# Predicting CO2 Emissions by Vehicles

## Overview

At a time when climate change and sustainability are at the forefront of global discussions, our "Predicting CO2 Emissions by Vehicles" project represents a crucial step towards understanding and reducing the ecological footprint of vehicles. Utilizing cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, this project aims to categorize vehicles into different energy classes and precisely predict CO2 emissions.

## Data Source

Our dataset, provided by the European Environment Agency (EEA) DataHub, includes detailed information on vehicle characteristics and emission figures, based on vehicles registered in France in 2021. With nearly 1.8 million observations, this dataset enables in-depth analysis and forms the basis for our predictive models.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to sort vehicles into energy classes using classification techniques and estimate CO2 emissions using regression models. These approaches are intended to not only provide insights into the determinants of CO2 emissions but also to present practical solutions for more environmentally friendly mobility.

## Methodology

- **Data Preparation:** Preparing and cleaning the dataset, including the removal of irrelevant features and handling of missing values.
- **Model Selection:** Training and comparing various ML models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks, to identify those with the highest predictive accuracy.
- **Analysis:** Examining the relationship between car properties and CO2 emissions, with a particular focus on fuel consumption, electric range, and vehicle type.

## Results

Our analysis revealed that fuel consumption and electric range are the strongest predictors of CO2 emissions. By adjusting our models, we achieved highly accurate predictions, with the Random Forest model standing out with an RÂ² value of 99.7%.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the significance of data science and technology in combating climate change. The insights gained can significantly contribute to the development of strategies that reduce vehicle CO2 output, thus having a positive impact on our environment.

## Application

The findings of this project can be utilized in various ways, from supporting policymakers in devising eco-friendly regulations to educating consumers about the environmental impacts of their vehicle choice. Moreover, the insights provide valuable information for automobile manufacturers seeking efficient and sustainable solutions.
